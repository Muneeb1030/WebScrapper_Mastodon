@coreyspowell,"Feb 22, 2024, 10:49",1h,More crazy numbers: The quasar J0529-4351 is powered by a black hole 17 billion times as massive as the Sun. It's the fastest-growing black hole ever observed. And it's so far away that its light has taken 12 billion years to reach us. We're seeing it as it was more than 7 billion years before the Earth even formed. https://www. eso.org/public/news/eso2402/ #science #nature #astrodon,0
