@appagalcrochet@mstdn.social,"Feb 22, 2024, 07:24",4h,"@mcc @tess I looked into them myself. The biggest issues: They will not go over 45-55 mph. They would not work well on major interstates here. They are very small compared to everything else on the roads here. If you get run over, they might find a small splat on the pavement that is oily of you... They have a limit on how far you can go on one charge... if you are just using it as a daily driver in the city, perfect. If you need it to take you to Great Aunt Millie's house 7 hours away...",0

@appagalcrochet@mstdn.social,"Feb 22, 2024, 08:27",3h,"@solarpunkgnome This is in regard to the LSEV's sold in China. Even the Wuling cars which have a top speed of 60 mph are not comfortable above 30 - 40 mph as they become harder to steer and you feel every single bump on the road. This is according to my neighbors who are from Jiangsu Province. Apparently going above 30 mph, you end up fighting the cars' desire to go in a straight line. And with such small wheels, you feel every pothole, all the more so given the poorly padded seats.",0
@appagalcrochet@mstdn.social,"Feb 22, 2024, 08:31",3h,"@solarpunkgnome This comment above was not concerning EV's available here in the US. It was specifically in response to the question posed about availability and use of LSEV's only sold in China. Personally, I ride my bike 90% of the year or walk. If I do use my vehicle it is for long drives to TN to visit family once or twice a year. Current miles driven the past 9 months... 1,892.4 miles. I have to crank it once a month and drive around the neighborhood just to keep life in the battery.",0
@0x575446,"Feb 22, 2024, 08:47",3h,@appagalcrochet I have a car that I only drive for about half of the year. I picked up a PWM Solar Charge Controller and a 30W panel for under $100 and store it hooked up to that. Fires right up no matter how long I leave it.,0

@tess,"Feb 22, 2024, 05:24",6h,"@mym if you can afford a new car, then $30K isn't bad. We've bought two used PHEVs for well under $20K.

@buermann,"Feb 22, 2024, 05:29",6h,"@tess Absolutely impossible to get a small anything, let alone a plugin-in hybrid that's good for getting around town off the plug but can still take you out of town without hour long pitstops at charging stations.

It's not like the administration is unaware that the NHTSA could bring the size of the fleet down by extending safety to include pedestrians, since they're taking a half-assed swing at it.",0
@mike805@noc.social,"Feb 22, 2024, 05:52",6h,@buermann I wanted to try out the Prius Prime and there's nowhere to even test drive it. Dealer's answer was basically put down a deposit and Toyota might build you one someday. Plus those cars have built in tracking devices that the user cannot turn off.,0
@buermann,"Feb 22, 2024, 06:02",6h,@mike805 That's right. Any time there's been a model I want it might as well be vaporware for all the free market can deliver.,0
@mike805@noc.social,"Feb 22, 2024, 06:05",6h,@buermann I downloaded and read the manual for the Prius Prime. It has all sorts of neat features including AC power onboard. Plus some creepy ones. The worst of which is the navigation and infotainment is all cloud based with a built in cellular modem you cannot turn off. And the navigation expires unless you pay for it.,0
@buermann,"Feb 22, 2024, 06:12",6h,"@mike805 I try to avoid using cars' consoles as much as possible since I find them even more distracting than my phone, so once I connect that to the car's bluetooth audio I basically never touch the console again.

@Salvo@aus.social,"Feb 22, 2024, 07:18",5h,@mike805 @buermann That’s the thing. The way manufacturers subsidise the price of all the superfluous electronic features is by selling your soul to the Data Brokers.,0
